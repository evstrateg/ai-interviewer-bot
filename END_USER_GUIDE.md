‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Reset is permanent and cannot be undone.

## ü§ñ Understanding Bot Responses

- **Context**: Background information when needed
- **Depth Level**: How deep into a topic you are (1-4)
- **Stage Progress**: Visual progress indicators

### Depth Levels
- **Level 1**: Initial question on new topic
- **Level 2**: First follow-up for examples
- **Level 3**: Deeper detail and specifics  
- **Level 4**: Maximum depth before moving on

### Progress Indicators
Look for these visual cues:
- `üîÑ Stage 3/9 (33%)` - Overall progress
- `üìä Completeness: 75%` - Stage completion
- `üéØ Depth: 2/4` - Question depth level

### Engagement Adaptation
The bot adjusts based on your responses:
- **High Engagement**: More detailed questions
- **Medium Engagement**: Standard progression
- **Low Engagement**: Simplified questions, encouragement

## üí° Tips for Great Interviews

### Before Starting
1. **Set aside time**: Plan for 90-120 minutes
2. **Choose environment**: Find a quiet space
3. **Gather thoughts**: Think about your role and experiences
4. **Choose style**: Pick the interviewer style that fits you

### During the Interview
1. **Be specific**: Use concrete examples and details
2. **Think out loud**: Share your thought processes
3. **Ask for clarification**: Don't hesitate to ask questions
4. **Take breaks**: Use natural pause points if needed

### Providing Great Responses
‚úÖ **Do:**
- Give specific examples
- Explain your reasoning
- Share both successes and failures
- Ask clarifying questions
- Mention tools, methods, and processes

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Give one-word answers
- Be overly general
- Skip questions you find challenging
- Rush through stages
- Forget to mention key experiences

### Example Good Response:
> **Bot**: "Can you describe your approach to project planning?"
> 
> **Good User Response**: "I use a hybrid approach combining Agile sprints with traditional milestone planning. For example, in my last project, I started with a 2-week discovery phase using design thinking workshops, then created a high-level roadmap with quarterly milestones. Within each quarter, I run 2-week sprints using Jira for tracking. The key insight I've learned is that stakeholder communication every Friday prevents most issues - I do 15-minute status calls with key stakeholders to catch problems early."
